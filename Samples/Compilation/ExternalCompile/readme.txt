External Compile Setting Example

This sample shows how to set the Chutzpah Compile setting to External (as opposed to the default mode of Executable).
With External mode set, Chutzpah assumes some external process/force is handling compilation and it will assume when it sees a Foo.ts that it can find a Foo.js given the Source/Out directories you provide.
