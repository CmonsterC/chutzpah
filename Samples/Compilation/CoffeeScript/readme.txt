CoffeeScript Compilation Settings Sample

This sample shows how to use the Chutzpah compile setting to run tests which compile coffeescript to a different directory. I purposefully put things in different folder to demonstrate the use of the compilation options like SourceDirectory and WorkingDirectory.

This assumes you have the coffee command on your system path.
